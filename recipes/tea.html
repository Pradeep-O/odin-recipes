    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tea is one of the most beloved beverages worldwide, cherished for its variety of flavors, calming qualities, and rich history. Made by steeping dried leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant in hot water, tea comes in many forms, including black, green, white, oolong, and herbal varieties. The differences in these types stem from how the leaves are processed, with black tea being fully oxidized, green tea minimally processed, and oolong tea partially oxidized. Each type offers its own unique flavor profile, ranging from the bold, robust taste of black tea to the delicate, grassy notes of green tea.</p>
    <p>Beyond its refreshing taste, tea has been a part of cultural rituals and social gatherings for centuries, from the traditional British afternoon tea to Japanese tea ceremonies. Herbal teas, made from flowers, herbs, and spices like chamomile or peppermint, offer a soothing alternative, often associated with relaxation and wellness. Tea can be enjoyed hot or iced, plain or flavored with ingredients like lemon, honey, or milk, making it a versatile and comforting drink for any occasion. Its gentle caffeine content provides a mild energy boost, while its antioxidants are believed to promote health, adding to its global appeal.</p>
