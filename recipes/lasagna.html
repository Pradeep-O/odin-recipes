    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a hearty, comforting Italian dish made up of layers of wide pasta sheets, savory meat or vegetable fillings, and rich sauces. The traditional version often features a combination of ground beef or pork, seasoned with garlic, onions, and herbs, and simmered in a flavorful tomato-based marinara sauce. The filling is then sandwiched between sheets of pasta, often with a creamy, tangy layer of béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese. The layers are stacked together and baked until golden, bubbly, and perfectly melded.</p>
    <p>This dish is a versatile classic, with numerous regional variations. Some recipes substitute the meat with vegetables like spinach or zucchini, while others may incorporate a blend of cheeses or different kinds of sauces, like a pesto or white sauce. The result is a rich and indulgent meal that balances hearty, satisfying textures with bright, savory flavors. Lasagna is often served as a main course, making it a popular choice for gatherings and celebrations, where its comforting nature makes it a favorite for many.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened (about 5 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef (or pork) and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes to blend the flavors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the noodles:
            <ul>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. If using regular noodles, drain them and lay them flat on a baking sheet to prevent sticking. If using no-boil noodles, skip this step.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the cheese mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella, the grated Parmesan, and the beaten egg. Mix until well combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of meat sauce on top of the ricotta.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering process, finishing with a layer of noodles, sauce, and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
